  abstract = {Background: Dynamic modelling provides a systematic framework to understand function in biological systems. Parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models remains a very challenging inverse problem due to its nonconvexity and ill-conditioning. Associated issues like overfitting and local solutions are usually not properly addressed in the systems biology literature despite their importance. Here we present a method for robust and efficient parameter estimation which uses two main strategies to surmount the aforementioned difficulties: (i) efficient global optimization to deal with nonconvexity, and (ii) proper regularization methods to handle ill-conditioning. In the case of regularization, we present a detailed critical comparison of methods and guidelines for properly tuning them. Further, we show how regularized estimations ensure the best trade-offs between bias and variance, reducing overfitting, and allowing the incorporation of prior knowledge in a systematic way. Results: We illustrate the performance of the presented method with seven case studies of different nature and increasing complexity, considering several scenarios of data availability, measurement noise and prior knowledge. We show how our method ensures improved estimations with faster and more stable convergence. We also show how the calibrated models are more generalizable. Finally, we give a set of simple guidelines to apply this strategy to a wide variety of calibration problems. Conclusions: Here we provide a parameter estimation strategy which combines efficient global optimization with a regularization scheme. This method is able to calibrate dynamic models in an efficient and robust way, effectively fighting overfitting and allowing the incorporation of prior information.},

  abstract = {A new member of the family of growth models described by Baranyi et al. (1993a) is introduced in which the physiological state of the cells is represented by a single variable. The duration of lag is determined by the value of that variable at inoculation and by the post-inoculation environment. When the subculturing procedure is standardized, as occurs in laboratory experiments leading to models, the physiological state of the inoculum is relatively constant and independent of subsequent growth conditions. It is shown that, with cells with the same pre-inoculation history, the product of the lag parameter and the maximum specific growth rate is a simple transformation of the initial physiological state. An important consequence is that it is sufficient to estimate this constant product and to determine how the environmental factors define the specific growth rate without modelling the environment dependence of the lag separately. Assuming that the specific growth rate follows the environmental changes instantaneously, the new model can also describe the bacterial growth in an environment where the factors, such as temperature, pH and a w, change with time.},

  abstract = {The potential of mathematical models describing the microbial behavior during food processing and storage largely depends on their predictive capabilities and, in this concern, model calibration plays a crucial role. Unfortunately, model calibration may only be performed successfully if the sources of information are sufficiently rich. Therefore, a careful experimental design is required. This contribution formulated the optimal experimental design (OED) problem as a general dynamic optimization problem where the objective was to optimize a certain criterion depending on the Fisher information matrix. This formulation allows for more flexibility in the experimental design, including initial conditions, sampling times, experimental durations, time-dependent manipulable variables and number of experiments as degrees of freedom. Moreover, the use of robust confidence regions for the parameter estimates was suggested as an alternative to evaluate the quality of the proposed experimental schemes. The OED for the calibration of the thermal death time and Ratkowsky-type secondary models was considered for illustrative purposes, showing how the usually disregarded E-optimality criterion results in the experimental schemes offering the best compromise precision/decorrelation among the parameters. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This work addresses a general methodology for designing optimal dynamic experiments for the purpose of model calibration. This methodology is general in the sense that it may be applied to any type of food processing model, being particularly relevant for predictive microbiology and quality assessment as the experimentation is both time consuming and expensive. The main advantages of the proposed technique are twofold: on one hand, it is able to significantly reduce the overall experimental burden, contributing not only to simplify the experimental planning, devising the most adequate experiments, but also minimizing the number of experiments, and on the other hand, the resultant experiments provide the maximum quantity and quality of information to improve the predictive capabilities of the models under consideration, of key importance for process design, optimization and control.}

These processes can be described by sets of non-linear differential and algebraic equations (DAEs), usually subject to constraints in the state and control variables. A review of the available solution techniques for this class of problems is presented, highlighting the numerical difficulties arising from the non-linear, constrained and often discontinuous nature of these systems. In order to surmount these difficulties, we present several alternative stochastic and hybrid techniques based on the control vector parameterization (CVP) approach. The CVP approach is a direct method which transforms the original problem into a non-linear programming (NLP) problem, which must be solved by a suitable (efficient and robust) solver. In particular, a hybrid technique uses a first global optimization phase followed by a fast second phase based on a local deterministic method, so it can handle the nonconvexity of many of these NLPs. The efficiency and robustness of these techniques is illustrated by solving several challenging case studies regarding the optimal control of fed-batch bioreactors and other bioprocesses. In order to fairly evaluate their advantages, a careful and critical comparison with several other direct approaches is provided. The results indicate that the two-phase hybrid approach presents the best compromise between robustness and efficiency.},

In the past, major effort has been put into the modeling of microbial growth and inactivation within a constant environment (static models). In the early 1990s, differential equation models (dynamic models) were introduced in the field of predictive microbiology. Here, we present a general dynamic model-building concept describing microbial evolution under dynamic conditions. Starting from an elementary model building block, the model structure can be gradually complexified to incorporate increasing numbers of influencing factors. Based on two case studies, the fundamentals of both macroscopic (population) and microscopic (individual) modeling approaches are revisited. These illustrations deal with the modeling of (i) microbial lag under variable temperature conditions and (ii) interspecies microbial interactions mediated by lactic acid production (product inhibition). Current and future research trends should address the need for (i) more specific measurements at the cell and/or population level, (ii) measurements under dynamic conditions, and (iii) more comprehensive (mechanistically inspired) model structures. In the context of quantitative microbial risk assessment, complexity of the mathematical model must be kept under control. An important challenge for the future is determination of a satisfactory trade-off between predictive power and manageability of predictive microbiology models.}

  abstract = {In predictive food microbiology, cardinal parameter models are often applied to describe the effect of temperature, pH and/or water activity on the microbial growth rate. To identify the model parameters, full factorial designs are often used, in spite of the high experimental burden and cost related to this method. In this work, the impact of the selected experimental scheme on the estimation of the parameters of the cardinal model describing the effect of temperature, pH and/or water activity has been evaluated. In a first step, identification of a simple model describing only the effect of temperature, pH or water activity was considered. The comparison of an equidistant design and a D-optimal (based) design showed that the latter, which is based on the model's sensitivity functions, yields more realistic parameter estimates than the typical equidistant design. By selecting the experimental levels based on the sensitivity functions, a more realistic description of the behavior around optimal conditions can be obtained. In the second step, focus was on the efficient and accurate estimation of the ten parameters of the extended cardinal model that describes the combined effect of temperature, pH and water activity on the microbial growth rate. Again, equidistant level selection is compared to a D-optimal (based) experimental design. In addition, a full factorial and a Latin-square approach are evaluated. From the simulation case studies presented, it can be stated that all parameters can be equally well defined from an equidistant design as from a D-optimal-based design. In addition, reducing the experimental load by constructing a Latin-square design does not hamper the parameter estimation procedure. This work confirms the observation of a previous study, i.e., for complex cases a Latin-square design is an attractive alternative for a full factorial design as it yields equally accurate and reliable parameter estimates while reducing the experimental workload.},

The approach makes use of the theory of optimal experimental design, to maximize data information and in this way reduce the number of experiments. The resulting growth model for specific spoilage microorganisms in hake (Merluccius merluccius) is sufficiently informative to estimate quality sensory indexes under time-varying temperature profiles. In addition it incorporates quantitative information of the uncertainty induced by fish variability. The model has been employed to test the effect of factors such as fishing gear or evisceration, on fish spoilage and therefore fish quality. Results show no significant differences in terms of microbial growth between hake fished by long-line or bottom-set nets, within the implicit uncertainty of the model. Similar conclusions can be drawn for gutted and un-gutted hake along the experiment horizon. In addition, whenever there is the possibility to carry out the necessary experiments, this approach is sufficiently general to be used in other fish species and under different stress variables.},

Moreover, robustness can also be interpreted as an additional and conflicting objective, since more robust solutions typically induce a performance decrease. The current manuscript exploits advanced deterministic techniques to efficiently and accurately generate Pareto sets in the presence of model uncertainty. The developed procedures allow the presentation of robust Pareto sets, i.e., Pareto sets in which robustness is an additional objective. Based on these Pareto sets, all trade-offs can clearly be assessed by the decision maker.

  abstract = {Dynamic process models can be used for operating, controlling and optimising important bioprocesses, e.g., pharmaceuticals production, enzyme production and brewing. After selecting an appropriate process model structure, parameter estimates have to be obtained based on real-life experiments. To reduce the amount of labour and often cost intensive experiments optimal experiment design (OED) is an indispensable tool. In optimal experiment design, dynamic input profiles have to be determined in order to obtain informative experiments. In the particular case of optimal experiment design for parameter estimation, a scalar measure of the Fisher Information Matrix is used as an objective function. Over the years, different criteria have been developed. However, the important question that remains is which criterion to choose. In this work, an approach to tackle the criterion selection is presented. In addition, a multi-objective optimisation approach is implemented, which enables to combine two, often competing optimisation criteria. The developed approach is illustrated with two case studies. The first case study is a fed-batch bioreactor model and the second case study is a Lotka Volterra fishing model.},

  abstract = {Predictive microbiology emerges more and more as a rational quantitative framework for predicting and understanding microbial evolution in food products. During the mathematical modeling of microbial growth and/or inactivation, great, but not always efficient, effort is spent on the determination of the model parameters from experimental data. In order to optimize experimental conditions with respect to parameter estimation, experimental design has been extensively studied since the 1980s in the field of bioreactor engineering. The so-called methodology of optimal experimental design established in this research area enabled the reliable estimation of model parameters from data collected in well-designed fed-batch reactor experiments. In this paper, we introduce the optimal experimental design methodology for parameter estimation in the field of predictive microbiology. This study points out that optimal design of dynamic input signals is necessary to maximize the information content contained within the resulting experimental data. It is shown that from few dynamic experiments, more pertinent information can be extracted than from the classical static experiments. By introducing optimal experimental design into the field of predictive microbiology, a new promising frame for maximization of the information content of experimental data with respect to parameter estimation is provided. As a case study, the design of an optimal temperature profile for estimation of the parameters D(ref) and z of an Arrhenius-type model for the maximum inactivation rate kmax as a function of the temperature, T, was considered. Microbial inactivation by heating is described using the model of Geeraerd et al. (1999). The need for dynamic temperature profiles in experiments aimed at the simultaneous estimation of the model parameters from measurements of the microbial population density is clearly illustrated by analytical elaboration of the mathematical expressions involved on the one hand, and by numerical simulations on the other.},

	abstract = {Functional response models are important in understanding predator–prey interactions. The development of functional response methodology has progressed from mechanistic models to more statistically motivated models that can account for variance and the over-dispersion commonly seen in the datasets collected from functional response experiments. However, little information seems to be available for those wishing to prepare optimal parameter estimation designs for functional response experiments. It is worth noting that optimally designed experiments may require smaller sample sizes to achieve the same statistical outcomes as non-optimally designed experiments. In this paper, we develop a model-based approach to optimal experimental design for functional response experiments in the presence of parameter uncertainty (also known as a robust optimal design approach). Further, we develop and compare new utility functions which better focus on the statistical efficiency of the designs; these utilities are generally applicable for robust optimal design in other applications (not just in functional response). The methods are illustrated using a beta-binomial functional response model for two published datasets: an experiment involving the freshwater predator Notonecta glauca (an aquatic insect) preying on Asellus aquaticus (a small crustacean), and another experiment involving a ladybird beetle (Propylea quatuordecimpunctata L.) preying on the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scopoli). As a by-product, we also derive necessary quantities to perform optimal design for beta-binomial regression models, which may be useful in other applications.},

By reducing our task to the setting of graphical models, we prove that the method finds a near-optimal design selection with a polynomial number of evaluations. Moreover, the method exhibits the best polynomial-complexity constant approximation factor, unless P = NP. We measure the performance of the method in comparison with established alternatives, such as ensemble non-centrality, on example models of different complexity. Efficient design accelerates the loop between modeling and experimentation: it enables the inference of complex mechanisms, such as those controlling central metabolic operation.Availability: Toolbox ‘NearOED’ available with source code under GPL on the Machine Learning Open Source Software Web site (mloss.org).Contact: busettoa@inf.ethz.chSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Instead, a linear relationship between in square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, square root = b (T - T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria.

We propose mathematical tools which can be used to collect data in an almost optimal way, by specifying the duration and distribution of time sampling in the measurements to be taken, consequently improving the accuracy (i.e., reducing the uncertainty in estimates) of the parameters to be estimated. We recall the concepts of traditional and generalized sensitivity functions and use these to develop a strategy to determine the “optimal” final time T for an experiment; this is based on the time evolution of the sensitivity functions and of the condition number of the Fisher information matrix. We illustrate the role of the sensitivity functions as tools in optimal design of experiments, in particular in finding “best” sampling distributions.

In other words, it tackles the problem of whether the right type of data is available to estimate the desired parameter values. Identifiability analysis is therefore an essential technique that should be adopted more routinely in practice, alongside complementary methods such as uncertainty analysis and evaluation of model performance.

In case there is a lack of identifiability, the symbolic computation quickly results in determination of the exact structure of the nullspace and a suitable re-parametrisation.

The difficulties are further illuminated by estimation examples using real data. It certain situations, in which the value of the ratio Ks/so is high or in which only few and noisy measurements are available, the linear approximation of the Michaelis-Menten equation gives a better fit. The practical difficulties in obtaining correct values of the model parameters do not limit the applicability of the Michaelis-Menten model, which in most cases explains the bacterial growth behavior excellently.

	abstract = {Designing an experiment for parameter estimation involves two steps. The first one is qualitative, and consists of selecting a suitable configuration of the input/output ports so as to make, if possible, all the parameters of interest identifiable. The second step is quantitative, and based on the optimization of a suitable criterion (with respect to the input shapes, sampling schedule,…) so as to get the maximum information from the data to be collected. When the model is nonlinear in the parameters, the typical situation for phenomenological models, both steps present specific difficulties which are discussed in this paper. The practical importance of qualitative experiment design is illustrated by a very simple biological model. Various policies presented in the literature for quantitative experiment design are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to methods allowing uncertainty on the prior information to be taken into account.},

	abstract = {The dynamic optimization (open loop optimal control) of non-linear bioprocesses is considered in this contribution. These processes can be described by sets of non-linear differential and algebraic equations (DAEs), usually subject to constraints in the state and control variables. A review of the available solution techniques for this class of problems is presented, highlighting the numerical difficulties arising from the non-linear, constrained and often discontinuous nature of these systems. In order to surmount these difficulties, we present several alternative stochastic and hybrid techniques based on the control vector parameterization (CVP) approach. The CVP approach is a direct method which transforms the original problem into a non-linear programming (NLP) problem, which must be solved by a suitable (efficient and robust) solver. In particular, a hybrid technique uses a first global optimization phase followed by a fast second phase based on a local deterministic method, so it can handle the nonconvexity of many of these NLPs. The efficiency and robustness of these techniques is illustrated by solving several challenging case studies regarding the optimal control of fed-batch bioreactors and other bioprocesses. In order to fairly evaluate their advantages, a careful and critical comparison with several other direct approaches is provided. The results indicate that the two-phase hybrid approach presents the best compromise between robustness and efficiency.},

The advantages of the algorithm for the efficient and reliable location of global optima are examined. The properties of these algorithms, as applied to chemical processes, are considered, with emphasis on the ease of handling constraints and the ease of implementation and interpretation of results. For the five processes, the efficiency of computation is improved compared with selected stochastic and deterministic algorithms. Results closer to the global optimum are reported for the optimal control of the penicillin reactor and the non-differentiable system.},

	abstract = {The estimation of parameters in semiempirical models is essential in numerous areas of engineering and applied science. In many cases these models are represented by a set of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations. This introduces difficulties from both a numerical and an optimization perspective. One such difficulty, which has not been adequately addressed, is the existence of multiple local minima. In this paper, two novel global optimization methods will be presented which offer a theoretical guarantee of convergence to the global minimum for a wide range of problems. The first is based on converting the dynamic system of equations into a set of algebraic constraints through the use of collocation methods. The reformulated problem has interesting mathematical properties which allow for the development of a deterministic branch and bound global optimization approach. The second method is based on the use of integration to solve the dynamic system of equations. Both methods will be applied to the problem of estimating parameters in differential-algebraic models through the error-in-variables approach. The mathematical properties of the formulation which lead to specialization of the algorithms will be discussed. Then, the computational aspects of both approaches will be presented and compared through their application to several problems involving reaction kinetics.},

Some of the pitfalls of naive penalty methods are discussed in these terms. The new ranking method is tested using a (/spl mu/, /spl lambda/) evolution strategy on 13 benchmark problems. Our results show that suitable ranking alone (i.e., selection), without the introduction of complicated and specialized variation operators, is capable of improving the search performance significantly.},

	abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) and its various strategies are applied for the optimal design of shell-and-tube heat exchangers in this study. The main objective in any heat exchanger design is the estimation of the minimum heat transfer area required for a given heat duty, as it governs the overall cost of the heat exchanger. Lakhs of configurations are possible with various design variables such as outer diameter, pitch, and length of the tubes, tube passes, baffle spacing, baffle cut, etc. Hence the design engineer needs an efficient strategy in searching for the global minimum. In the present study for the first time DE, an improved version of genetic algorithms (GAs), has been successfully applied with different strategies for 1,61,280 design configurations using Bell's method to find the heat transfer area. In the application of DE, 9680 combinations of the key parameters are considered. For comparison, GAs are also applied for the same case study with 1080 combinations of its parameters. For this optimal design problem, it is found that DE, an exceptionally simple evolution strategy, is significantly faster compared to GA and yields the global optimum for a wide range of the key parameters.},

  title = {Examination of Stopping Criteria for Differential Evolution based on a Power Allocation Problem},
  address={Brasov, Romania},
  abstract={Usually the primary goal for the application of optimization algorithms is convergence to the global optimum, and the secondary goal is to use the least computational effort. By application of different stopping criteria the achievement of both objectives is influenced: If an optimization run is terminated too early, convergence may not be reached, but on the other hand computational resources may be wasted if the optimization run is stopped late. Because the two criteria that are applied mostly in evolutionary algorithms literature have some drawbacks, several stopping criteria are analyzed in this work, using the Differential Evolution algorithm. In contrast to a prior study a constrained optimization problem is used here. It consists of optimizing the power allocation for a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system that includes a parallel interference cancellation technique.},
